## Instructions to compile and run this project
1. Download and extract twitter_combined.txt.gz from [this](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Twitter.html) link. Place the text file in /final_project/data. You will need to create this data folder. Otherwise, any other data file can be used, but ensure it is formatted as described in main.cpp.

2. Edit main.cpp to analyze the data you would like

3. From terminal, enter the code directory by typing `cd code` from the final_project directory.

4. Here, you can use any of the make targets available. The relevant ones will be `make test` to create a test executable, and `make main` to create an executable called main to run the code you updated.

5. Run `./main` or `./test` to run the executables.

6. If using PageRank, make sure input files are at most 10000 lines (edges)

7. View results!

8. More documentation can be seen in main.cpp.
