Week of Nobember 8, 2020:

This week we came up with our group, and brainstormed some project ideas informally. Not much work was done, nor expected, in this stage of the project.


Week of November 15, 2020:

This week we met as a group multiple times over discord and discussed project goals and the team contract. We came up with guidelines and rules, how much we would commit to the project, and how much work we would each individualy do. Additionally, we discussed potential ideas for our project and came up with the idea described in the GOALS document.


Week of November 22, 2020:

Thanksgiving/fall break


Week of November 29, 2020:

Setup code foundation with proper files for graph implementations, etc. Implemented reading in of data and proper datafile format, as well as implementing a BFS traversal. We also wrote unit tests to ensure that these were correct. Next week, we will be working on Dijkstra's algorithm and PageRank. Had mid-project meeting, and made sure we were on track to finish on time. We discussed next steps and potential issue we might run into.


Week of December 6, 2020:

This week, we wrote and updated the unit tests for all algorithms - BFS, Dijkstra's, and PageRank. Additionally, we wrote the actual implementations for Dijkstra's and PageRank. We had some issues with runtime on PageRank due to the size of our data, so we had to select part of the data to use instead. In addition to the code, we did the project writeup and presentation video. The writeup is located in the info/ directory and the video is linked in the readme (hosted on google drive).
